# WorldWise Web App

App for keeping track of your favourite places that you have visited

## Tech Used

In this Project i learned about context api (Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level) also implemented useReducer hook (useReducer is very similar to useState , but it lets you move the state update logic from event handlers into a single function outside of your component)
